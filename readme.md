Here I was solving a bunch of exercises from W3Resource.

1. Write a JavaScript function that reverses a number.
Example x = 32243;
Expected Output : 34223

2. Write a JavaScript function that checks whether a passed string is a palindrome or not?
A palindrome is word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., madam or nurses run.

3. Write a JavaScript function that generates all combinations of a string.
Example string : 'dog'
Expected Output : d,do,dog,o,og,g

4. Write a JavaScript function that returns a string that has letters in alphabetical order.
Example string : 'webmaster'
Expected Output : 'abeemrstw'
Assume punctuation and numbers symbols are not included in the passed string.

5. Write a JavaScript function that accepts a string as a parameter and converts the first letter of each word into upper case.
Example string : 'the quick brown fox'
Expected Output : 'The Quick Brown Fox '
